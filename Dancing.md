operating systems that allow system administrators to have remote access to every disk volume on a
network-connected system. These shares may not be permanently deleted but may be disabled.
C$ - Administrative share for the C:\ disk volume. This is where the operating system is hosted.
IPC$ - The inter-process communication share. Used for inter-process communication via named
pipes and is not part of the file system.

What does the 3-letter acronym SMB stand for? 
SMB is one of the most basic and well-known protocols out there. You can easily search the acronym of any protocol that you don't know on Internet and the full name of the protocol will come up as the first result. When using acronyms, remember that the first letter of each word is always capitalized as standard. This is called Camel Case (or Medial Capitals).

*Server Message Block *

What port does SMB use to operate at? 
A simple portscan using version detection can get you this result. Also, Googling the port value will return the services used for that port in most cases.
*445*

What is the service name for port 445 that came up in our Nmap scan? 
You will need to use the -sV switch during your nmap scan in order to see this in your results! The answer creates a ? at the end, so remember to include it!
*microsoft-ds *

What is the 'flag' or 'switch' we can use with the SMB tool to 'list' the contents of the share? 
The acronym of this flag stands for 'list', and is precedes by a '-'.
*-L*

How many shares are there on Dancing? 
Use "smbclient -L" to list them.
*4*

What is the name of the share we are able to access in the end with a blank password? 
It's the one that doesn't terminate with the '$' symbol. This is a custom share, made by a system administrator during the configuration phase.
*WorkShares *

What is the command we can use within the SMB shell to download the files we find? 
This is the same command used during the interaction with the FTP shell in the previous box!
*get*

Submit root flag 
*5f61c10dffbc77a704d76016a22f1664*
