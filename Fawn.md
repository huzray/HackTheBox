What does the 3-letter acronym FTP stand for? 
*File Transfer Protocol *

Which port does the FTP service listen on usually? 
*21*

What acronym is used for the secure version of FTP? 
*sftp*

What is the command we can use to send an ICMP echo request to test our connection to the target? 
*ping*

From your scans, what version is FTP running on the target?
*vsftpd 3.0.3 *

From your scans, what OS type is running on the target? 
*Unix*

What is the command we need to run in order to display the 'ftp' client help menu? 
*ftp -h *

What is username that is used over FTP when you want to log in without having an account? 
When your name is not known, you are...

*anonymous*

What is the response code we get for the FTP message 'Login successful'? 
Response codes are important because we can tell what the service is reporting back to us at a glance. For example, we're all acquainted with the '404' code. We can even use it as a casual joke nowadays. '404' is the web protocol response code for 'Not Found', telling us that the resource we are trying to reach could not be found by the web server. In our case as well, the response code is made of '3' digits.
*230*

There are a couple of commands we can use to list the files and directories available on the FTP server. One is dir. What is the other that is a common way to list files on a Linux system. 
Try running help from within FTP to see the possible commands.
*ls*

What is the command used to download the file we found on the FTP server? 
Using the 'help' command within the 'ftp service' will reveal this command. Its' meaning is straight-forward.
*get*
