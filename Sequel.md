With an ounce of luck, our connection is accepted without a password requirement. We are placed in a
MySQL service shell from where we can explore the tables and data therein that are available to us. If you
need help with MySQL command syntax, you can refer to the cheatsheet provided by MySQLTutorial.
The commands we are going to use are essential for navigation:
Note that it is essential to end each command with the ; symbol, as it declares the end of the command.
Apart from that, SQL is a query-oriented language, which means that you supply it with one query at a time.
From the output, the htb database seems to be of value to us. In order to see what rests inside it, we will
need to "select" the htb database as the active one - the database we want to actively interact with for our
subsequent commands. To achieve this, the USE htb; command can be used.

SHOW databases; : Prints out the databases we can access.
USE {database_name}; : Set to use the database named {database_name}.
SHOW tables; : Prints out the available tables inside the current
database.
SELECT * FROM {table_name}; : Prints out all the data from the table {table_name}.

What does the acronym SQL stand for? *Structured Query Language*
During our scan, which port running mysql do we find? *3306*
What community-developed MySQL version is the target running? *MariaDB*
What switch do we need to use in order to specify a login username for the MySQL service?  *-u*
Which username allows us to log into MariaDB without providing a password? The root of all evil. *root*
What symbol can we use to specify within the query that we want to display everything inside a table? This will make you starry-eyed. ***
What symbol do we need to end each query with? You can find the answer by reading the write-up carefully. *;*
