the script will now
only search if any entry exists with the username admin . In this case, we got lucky. There is indeed an
account called admin , which will validate our SQL Injection and return the 1 value for the $count variable,
which will be put through the if statement , allowing us to log-in without knowing the password. If there
was no admin account, we could try any other accounts until we found one that existed. ( administrator ,
root , john_doe , etc.) Any valid, existing username would make our SQL Injection work.

username: admin'#   password: a

# comment

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'#' AND password='a'

admin'-- -
