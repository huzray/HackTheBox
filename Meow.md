Download vpn from lab

What does the acronym VM stand for? 
*Virtual Machine *

What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to issue commands via the command line, such as the one to start our VPN connection? It's also known as a console or shell. 
*terminal*

What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs? 
*openvpn*

Let the configuration script run until you see the Initialization Sequence Completed message at the
very end of the output. Once that is present, make sure that there is no mention of multiple tunnel
interfaces, such as tun1 , tun2 , and so forth. Having multiple tunnel interfaces can ruin the stability of your
connection to the target and create routing conflicts on your Operating System, which would only bring
frustration. There should only be tun0

What is the abbreviated name for a 'tunnel interface' in the output of your VPN boot-up sequence output? 
*tun*

What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request? 
It's also half of the name of a very popular sport, also known as table tennis.
*ping*

What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target? 
*nmap*

What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans? 
This service runs on port 23/tcp by default, meaning we can research the port on Google and receive the correct result easily.
*telnet*
